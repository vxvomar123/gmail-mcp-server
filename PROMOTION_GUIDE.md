## 📅 Launch Strategy (Week 1)

### Day 1: Initial Push

**Reddit Posts** (4 posts, different communities):

1. **r/ClaudeAI** - Primary target
   ```
   Title: I fixed the broken Gmail MCP servers - here's v2.0 with bulletproof auth

   Body:
   After struggling with existing Gmail MCP servers (broken auth, no maintenance),
   I completely rewrote one from scratch.

   ✅ Authentication actually works (auto-refresh, clear error messages)
   ✅ No OpenAI dependency (direct Gmail API)
   ✅ Complete features (attachments, labels, filters, batch ops)
   ✅ Actually maintained

   Demo: [GIF showing sending email from Claude Desktop]

   GitHub: https://github.com/devdattatalele/gmail-mcp-server

   Feedback welcome! What features would you want?
   ```

2. **r/LocalLLaMA** - AI enthusiasts
   ```
   Title: Gmail automation with Claude Desktop - no API costs

   Body:
   Built a Gmail MCP server that lets Claude manage your email:
   - Send/read emails with attachments
   - Auto-organize inbox with labels and filters
   - Batch operations for efficiency
   - 100% free (no OpenAI API needed)

   Example: "Archive all newsletters from last month" → Done in seconds

   This is what MCP was made for - practical AI assistance.

### Day 1-2: Developer Communities

**Hacker News** (Show HN):
```
Title: Show HN: Gmail MCP Server v2.0 – The one that actually works

I've been frustrated with existing Gmail MCP servers for Claude Desktop.
They all have broken authentication or require unnecessary OpenAI API keys.

So I rewrote one from scratch with:
- Bulletproof OAuth (auto-refresh, clear errors)
- No third-party AI dependencies
- Production-ready TypeScript
- Complete documentation

Live demo: [Link to showcase]
GitHub: [Link]

Looking forward to feedback!

### Day 2-3: Twitter/X Campaign

**Tweet Thread** (10 tweets):

```
1/ 🧵 I just open-sourced a Gmail MCP server for Claude Desktop that actually works.

After weeks of broken auth and missing features from other solutions,
I rebuilt it from scratch. Here's what makes it different:

2/ 🔐 Authentication that actually works

Existing servers fail with cryptic errors. Mine has:
- Auto-refresh tokens
- Clear error messages with solutions
- Pre-flight checklist
- Force re-auth with one flag

3/ 💰 100% Free (No OpenAI API)

Other solutions require OpenAI API for... sending emails? 🤔

This uses Gmail API directly:
- No extra costs
- Better privacy
- Faster responses

4/ 📦 Actually Feature-Complete

- Send/read emails (with attachments)
- Download attachments
- Labels & filters
- Batch operations (50 emails at once)
- HTML email support
- Email threading

5/ 🛠️ Production-Ready Code

- TypeScript throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security best practices
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Complete documentation

6/ 📚 Documentation You'll Actually Read

- Step-by-step setup guide
- Troubleshooting for every common issue
- 50+ example use cases
- Complete API reference
- Contributing guide

7/ 🎬 See it in action:

"Send quarterly report to client@company.com with the PDF from my Documents folder"

Claude → Uses MCP → Email sent with attachment

No copy/paste, no UI switching. Just natural language.

8/ 🌟 Why This Matters

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI assistants interact with real tools.

Email is one of the most requested features. But existing servers were broken.

Now it finally works.

9/ 🚀 Try It Yourself

1. git clone https://github.com/devdattatalele/gmail-mcp-server
2. npm install && npm run build
3. node dist/index.js auth
4. Configure Claude Desktop
5. Send emails with AI!

Full guide: [link to README]

10/ 🙏 Help Make It Better

- 🐛 Report issues
- 💡 Suggest features
- 🔧 Contribute code
- 📢 Share with others

Let's make AI email automation accessible to everyone!
